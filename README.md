<h3>About me</h3>

I am working as a Data & Cloud Engineer at [dataroots](https://www.dataroots.io/), where I build data platforms that (hopefully) scale to deal with BIG Data. Preferably on AWS.

I mainly work with:

- <b>Programming languages:</b> Python, Go
- <b>Cloud platforms:</b> AWS
- <b>IaC:</b> Terraform

## <h3>Projects</h3>

On the side, I like to work on miscellaneous projects, some useful, some not so much.

Recently, I have created:

- [tf-profile](https://www.github.com/datarootsio/tf-profile) is a tool to parse Terraform logs | <i>Go, Terraform</i>
- [terraform-provider-dagster](https://www.github.com/datarootsio/terraform-provider-dagster) is a Terraform provider for Dagster | <i>Go, Terraform, Dagster</i>
- [car-simulator](https://www.github.com/quintenbruynseraede/car-simulator) simulates the electronics in a car in an event-driven manner | <i>Go</i>
- [time2go](https://www.github.io/quintenbruynseraede/time2go) is a web app to find the best time to do some exercise | <i>Go, HTMX, TailwindCSS</i>

I have contributed to:

- [dagster](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster), a data orchestration tool
- [tf-summarize](https://www.github.com/dineshba/tf-summarize), a tool to summarize Terraform logs
